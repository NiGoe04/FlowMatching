empirical observations:
- Bounded sets seem to work slightly better
- TO DO: Do all distributions work?
- If the variance is too huge, too tiny -> vector field collapses
    - Hypothesis: "The distributions match well when their support covers the same region with similar scale."
    -> This idea is intuitive for 2D point distributions, but how is it for e.g. pictures (MNIST!), calculate per pixel standard variance?




random notes:
- bounded gauss model does not benefit as much from more epochs during training
