Flow models:
    - Continuous Time Markov Process (CTMP): continous model + markov assumption
    - Flows are the simplest forms of CTMPS, we focus on them
    - flows can transform any source distribution p into any target distribution q, as long as these two have densities
    - ODEs for flows can be solved more efficiently than SDEs for diffusion processes
    - flow model X_t = f(X_0) defined by diffeomorphism f
    - CDiffeomorphism f: invertable, and f
